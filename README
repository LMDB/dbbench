DBbench - Embedded Database Benchmark

This is a rewrite of Google LevelDB's dbbench tool in C, and ported
to a wide variety of other embedded database engines. A framework has
been created to minimize the amount of code that must be written for
any particular DB engine. Adding support for a new engine just
requires writing a small C wrapper providing DB open, close, read,
and write routines, plus optional command line parameters as needed.
